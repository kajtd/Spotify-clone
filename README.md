# Spotify-clone
Simple app using spotify API. With an app you are able to search for songs and get the lyrics. I am planning to improve the app in the future, add additional features and create
good looking design.

Installation <br />
git clone git@github.com:kajtd/Spotify-clone.git

Create .env file in server directory and put three variables there: 
- REDIRECT_URI(which is a redirection link)
- CLIENT_ID(taken from your spotify app)
- CLIENT_SECRET(taken from your spotify app)

* cd client <br>
* npm install <br>
* npm start <br>
* cd server <br>
* npm install <br>
* npm start <br>
